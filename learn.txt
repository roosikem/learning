Added the apiKey for the specified appid in the Secret Manager.
If the provided URL does not contain a file name, a file name is generated dynamically based on the contentType.
Successfully implemented file upload functionality to AWS S3.

Title: Generate and Display One-Time Password on Successful User Creation

Description:

When a user is created, a password should be automatically generated and displayed only once after successful user creation. The password will not be shown again, so users or admins need to ensure they save the credentials immediately.

Requirements:

Password Generation:
Automatically generate a strong password during the user creation process.
One-Time Display:
After successful user creation, display the generated password on the screen, informing the user/admin that this is the only time it will be shown.
Add a message to the UI prompting the user to save the password securely, as it will not be retrievable later.
UI Changes:
Modify the user creation success message to include the generated password.
Add a clear instruction in the UI to ensure the password is saved immediately.
No Password Storage for Viewing:
Ensure that after the initial display, the password is not retrievable from the UI or API.
The system should not provide any way to view the password again after the initial creation display.
Acceptance Criteria:

A strong password is generated automatically at the time of user creation.
The generated password is displayed only once after successful creation and is not viewable again.
A clear prompt is shown to save the password immediately.
Ensure that if the password is not saved, the only way to access the account is through a password reset process.
Testing:

Verify that a strong password is generated during user creation.
Validate that the password is displayed only once after successful user creation.
Ensure that the password is not accessible after the initial display.
Test scenarios where users forget to save the password and ensure they can reset it through the usual password recovery process.


Description:

The User entity already contains a teams field (array of Team IDs), but this field is not available for user creation through the UI or API. We need to expose the teams field in the UserDto and ensure it is available for user creation.

Current Fields in User Creation:

name: User's full name
organizationId: ID of the organization the user belongs to
roleId: ID representing the role assigned to the user
teams: Already present in the entity but not available in UserDto for creation
Changes Required:

UserDto (Creation):
Add the teams field (array of Team IDs) to UserDto so it can be used during the user creation process in the API.
UI Changes:
Modify the user creation UI to include a field for selecting one or more teams (an array of team IDs).
Ensure users can select from a list of available teams during the creation process.
Acceptance Criteria:

The teams field is added to UserDto and is available for user creation via the API.
The teams field is displayed in the user creation form in the UI, allowing users to select teams.
Validate that the user creation process successfully associates the user with the selected teams.
Ensure backward compatibility so that users can still be created without selecting teams (optional field).
Testing:

Verify that the teams field is correctly processed when a user is created via the API.
Validate that the UI allows selecting teams and that the selected teams are correctly saved for the new user.
Ensure users without any selected teams can still be created successfully.


Title: Add "Teams" field to User entity with an array of Team IDs

Description:

We need to update the existing User entity by adding a new field to store the association with teams. The new field will hold an array of Team IDs.

Current Fields:

name: User's full name
organizationId: ID of the organization the user belongs to
roleId: ID representing the role assigned to the user
New Field to Add:

teams: An array of Team IDs (e.g., teams: [teamId1, teamId2, teamId3])
Acceptance Criteria:

The teams field should be an array of integers or UUIDs, representing the Team IDs the user is part of.
Ensure backward compatibility with existing users who do not yet have any teams.
Update any relevant services, models, and database schemas to include this new field.
Modify API endpoints where necessary to handle this new field for create, update, and fetch operations.
Testing:

Ensure that the teams field can be properly populated and retrieved via API.
Validate that users without teams do not break any existing functionality.

Title: Proxy Error Causing Intermittent Failures in Auth and Message APIs

Description:

We have observed a Proxy Error impacting both the auth API and the message API. The issue is not isolated to the auth API; it affects both APIs due to network disturbances.

Detailed Analysis:
Auth API:
The auth API is failing on the first hit due to the absence of a configured retry count. Since no retry mechanism is in place, the authentication process stops immediately upon encountering the error.
Message API:
The message API also experiences the same proxy-related error. However, it has a retry count configured. The retry mechanism triggers upon failure, leading to a successful response on subsequent attempts.
Root Cause:
The underlying cause appears to be related to network or proxy issues. The proxy error is affecting multiple APIs, not just the auth API. Other APIs are also experiencing impacts due to network disruptions at the same time.
Recommendations:
Configure Retry Mechanism:
Implement a retry mechanism for the auth API, similar to the one used for the message API. This will ensure that the auth API can connect successfully on subsequent attempts if the initial request fails due to a proxy error.
Investigate Network Stability:
Conduct a thorough investigation to identify the root cause of the network disturbances. Understanding and resolving these network issues will be crucial in preventing similar proxy errors across all APIs.



Hi,

Could we schedule a call to discuss an issue I’m facing with entity mapping, specifically with or without using @DBRef?

When I update a child entity individually, the changes are not reflected everywhere, and the system is still returning the old value. I believe it would be helpful to review this together.

Please let me know a convenient time for you.

Thank you!

Hi,

Could we schedule a call to discuss an issue I’m facing with entity mapping, particularly with or without using @DBRef?

The problem occurs when we update an entity individually. If that entity is also part of another entity, the updated details do not reflect when we fetch the other entity. Instead, we still see the old details of the updated entity. I think it would be useful to review this together.

Please let me know a convenient time for you.

Thank you!

Hi,

function hasImageExtension(fileName) {
    const imageExtensions = ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.gif', '.bmp', '.webp'];
    const lowerCaseFileName = fileName.toLowerCase();
    return imageExtensions.some(extension => lowerCaseFileName.endsWith(extension));
}

"When we use DBRef in a MongoDB entity, there is a problem with entity mapping when there are two separate databases:

Organization - is in database1
Configuration Entity - is in database2
When we try to map the Organization entity inside the Configuration Entity and then retrieve the Configuration from database1, the Organization entity returns as null.

To resolve this problem, we can use:

java
Copy code
@DBRef(db = "databaseName")
This can be used during entity mapping."

Title: Sending File Attachment Object to Chatbot and Updating Existing Request Format

Description:
The current chatbot messaging system does not support sending file attachments alongside text messages. We need to extend the functionality of the formatedMessage method to include file attachment objects and modify the existing request format to handle attachments properly. This task involves adapting the method to ensure that attachments are sent along with the request when present, while maintaining backward compatibility with existing text message functionality.

Acceptance Criteria:

The formatedMessage method should be updated to handle both text and file attachments.
The message payload sent to the chatbot should include:
messageId: Identifier for the message.
content: The text message in textPlain.
attachments: The file attachment(s) if present.
The request format should dynamically adapt based on the presence of attachments, ensuring the attachment object is correctly added to the request when provided.
If neither text nor attachments are present, the method should return an empty object.
Maintain backward compatibility with requests containing only text.
Ensure correct attachment handling in the chatbot for different file types (e.g., PDFs, images).
Technical Details:

Modify the formatedMessage method to check for both text (txt) and attachments (attachments).
Update the request structure to include the attachment object in the message payload if attachments exist.
Ensure the chatbot processes file attachments correctly, alongside or independent of text messages.
Handle cases where only one of the fields (text or attachments) is present, and adjust the request accordingly.
Return an empty object when neither text nor attachments are available.

Subject: Request for Approval to Use Insomnia API Testing Tool
Dear [Recipient's Name],
I hope this email finds you well. After evaluating various API testing tools, we have identified Insomnia as a suitable option that aligns with our security requirements. One of the key features of Insomnia is that it allows us to use the tool without the need for logging in, ensuring that no data is stored in the cloud. This addresses our primary security concern of maintaining full control over sensitive data.
Before proceeding, I would like to kindly request your approval to use Insomnia for our API testing. Please review and confirm that it adheres to all our security norms.
Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your feedback.

Title: Remove Dummy Data Creation from Application Startup and Implement Conditional Data Creation
Description: The current application creates dummy data upon startup, which is no longer required. The task involves removing this dummy data creation and replacing it with conditional logic to create the following data only if it is not found in the database:
Roles: Check if the required roles exist. If they do not, create them.
Organization: Ensure that one organization exists. If none is found, create a default organization.
Team: Ensure that at least one team exists. If no team is found, create a default team.
Super Admin User: Verify that a super admin user exists. If not, create a default super admin user.
Acceptance Criteria:
The application no longer creates dummy data on startup.
Data creation logic is implemented to check if the above entities exist and only create them if they are not found in the database.
The application should start without errors, and the necessary data should be available if missing.
Impact: This will clean up the startup process and ensure that the necessary data is created only when it is needed, improving the stability and flexibility of the system.

Jira Ticket: Organization Tab Testing
Summary:
Testing the functionality of the Organization Tab, including creating organizations, validating unique organization names, fetching all organizations, and editing existing organizations.
Test Scenarios:
Create Organization with Name and Country
Name Validation (Organization already exists)
Fetch All Organizations
Edit Existing Organization
1. Create Organization with Name and Country
Objective: Ensure that an organization can be created successfully by providing a valid name and country.
Test Steps:
Navigate to the "Organization" tab.
Click on "Create Organization."
Input a valid name (e.g., "ABC Corp") and select a country (e.g., "United States").
Submit the form.
Expected Result:
The organization should be successfully created and displayed in the list.
The system should show a success message confirming the organization creation (e.g., "Organization ABC Corp created successfully").
Edge Cases:
Attempt to create an organization with an empty name or country.
Expected Result: The system should display an error message, such as "Name and Country are required fields."
2. Name Validation (Organization Already Exists)
Objective: Ensure that creating an organization with an already existing name is blocked by validation.
Test Steps:
Navigate to the "Organization" tab.
Attempt to create an organization with a name that already exists (e.g., "ABC Corp").
Input the same country or a different one.
Expected Result:
The system should display a validation error like "Organization name already exists."
The user should be unable to create the organization until a unique name is provided.
3. Fetch All Organizations
Objective: Verify that all existing organizations can be retrieved and displayed correctly.
Test Steps:
Navigate to the "Organization" tab.
Click on "Fetch All Organizations" or ensure the organization list is displayed upon page load.
Expected Result:
The system should display a list of all organizations in a table or grid format.
Each organization should display key details like Name, Country, and Date Created.
Edge Cases:
If no organizations exist:
Expected Result: The system should display a message like "No organizations found."
4. Edit Existing Organization
Objective: Ensure that an existing organization can be edited successfully.
Test Steps:
Navigate to the "Organization" tab.
Select an organization from the list (e.g., "ABC Corp").
Click on "Edit Organization."
Update the name (e.g., from "ABC Corp" to "ABC Corporation") or change the country.
Submit the form.
Expected Result:
The system should update the organization details successfully.
A confirmation message should appear, such as "Organization updated successfully."
The updated organization should be reflected in the organization list.
Edge Cases:
Attempt to change the name to an existing organization name.
Expected Result: The system should display an error message like "Organization name already exists."
Testing Artifacts:
Preconditions: User must be logged in with the necessary permissions to create, edit, and view organizations.
Postconditions: After testing, the system should have accurate organization data reflecting the test operations.




Jira Ticket: User Management (Create, Edit, View, and List)
Test Scenarios:
Create User
Password Handling
Edit User (without showing the password)
View User Details
List All Users
1. Create User
Objective: Ensure that a user can be successfully created by providing valid details (username, role, organization, team) and receiving a password.
Test Steps:
Navigate to the "Users" section.
Click on "Create User."
Fill in the required fields (Username, Role, Organization, Team).
Submit the form.
Expected Result:
The system should successfully create the user and display a success message (e.g., "User created successfully").
A password should be generated for the user and displayed on the screen for the first time.
The user should receive the password through an appropriate channel (e.g., email, secure message).
Edge Cases:
Attempt to create a user with an empty username.
Expected Result: The system should display an error message, such as "Username is required."
2. Password Handling
Objective: Ensure that the password is securely generated and displayed only once after the user is created. The password should not be shown again in any subsequent operations (edit or view).
Test Steps:
After creating the user, the system should generate and display the password only once.
Ensure the password is stored securely in the backend (e.g., hashed).
Expected Result:
The password should be shown only on the creation page and not stored in plain text.
If the user forgets the password, they should go through the "Forgot Password" flow rather than viewing it on the edit or view pages.
Security Consideration:
The password should never be displayed in plain text after the creation process.
3. Edit User (without showing the password)
Objective: Ensure that the user can edit their details (e.g., username, role, organization, team) without displaying or editing the password field.
Test Steps:
Navigate to the "Users" section.
Select an existing user and click on "Edit User."
Edit the fields such as Username, Role, Organization, and Team.
Submit the form.
Expected Result:
The user details should be updated successfully without showing the password field.
The system should not display the password in any form during the edit process.
Edge Cases:
Attempt to edit a user and provide invalid data (e.g., empty username).
Expected Result: The system should display an error message, such as "Username cannot be empty."

The system should be updated to restrict users from deleting their own accounts if they have the necessary permissions for account deletion.
Acceptance Criteria:
Users with access to the "User Deletion" feature should not be able to delete their own account.
An appropriate warning or error message should be displayed if a user attempts to delete their own account.
User deletion functionality for other users remains unaffected.
Proper logs should be maintained for any attempted self-deletion action.

-------

The issue is occurring due to a socket timeout error. The configured timeout is set to 30 seconds, and the retry count is already configured to 2. In this case, the plugin sends the request again after 30 seconds. When the plugin receives a response, it sends it back to the Genesis server.

Additionally, it is observed that Genesis cancels the request, but the plugin receives the stop request after 2 minutes. Before this 2-minute period, the plugin had already sent the response back to Genesis because it had not yet received the stop request. Since the session was still active during this time, the plugin was able to send the response to the Genesis server, as the session was considered alive at that moment.

The instructed exception in logs occurs because the Genesis server triggers a session close request, calling the onCommandStop() method in the plug-in for each conversation. This method closes resources associated with that specific conversation and stops the corresponding thread.


Since stopping a thread forcefully always throws an exception, this is expected behavior. The system is functioning as designed, and there is no issue here.

Issue Analysis:
We observed that the actual processing time between the two timestamps is 542 milliseconds (0.542 seconds). However, the application is introducing an additional 1000-millisecond pause before sending the response. As a result, the total response time becomes 1542 milliseconds (542 ms + 1000 ms) instead of just the actual processing duration.
Impact:
This additional delay may be causing unnecessary latency in the system, affecting overall performance.
Suggested Action:
We need to investigate the reason behind this 1000-millisecond wait time and determine whether it is an intentional delay or an unintended bottleneck. If it's unnecessary, optimizing this delay could help improve response times significantly.

Corrected Version:

The onCommandStop operation and the thread sending a message to Genesis are happening almost simultaneously. Due to this, the logic prevents the thread from sending another message to close the session, which is why an exception is being logged.

This issue is more likely to occur in a production-like environment, where user capacity is high, and users may not be interested in the response.

You can also replicate the same issue in the test environment by simulating the same scenario.

Jira Ticket Description

Title: Notify Agent When Conversation Chat is Closed

Description:
Currently, agents are not notified when a conversation chat is closed. This results in uncertainty and delays in response time. We need to implement a real-time notification mechanism to inform agents when a conversation chat ends.

Expected Behavior:

When a conversation chat is closed, the agent should receive an instant notification.

The notification should include session details such as conversation ID, timestamp, and closure reason (if applicable).

The notification should be displayed within the agent's UI for better visibility.


Acceptance Criteria:

1. Agents should receive a real-time notification when a conversation chat is closed.


2. The notification should contain all relevant session details.


3. The implementation should be seamless and not disrupt the agent’s workflow.


4. The solution should be tested in a controlled environment before deployment.

Jira Ticket Description

Title: Implement Disconnect API for Closing Conversations in Genesys

Description:
We need to implement the Genesys Disconnect API to ensure that a conversation is properly closed when it ends. This will be achieved by sending an event type "closed session" via WebSocket, instructing the bridge to trigger the Disconnect API for terminating the conversation.

Once the "closed session" event response is successfully received, the Single UI will close the WebSocket connection to complete the process.

Implementation Details:

1. When a conversation ends, an event type "closed session" will be sent via WebSocket to the bridge.


2. The bridge will call the Genesys Disconnect API to close the session from the Genesys server.


3. Once the Disconnect API response is received, the Single UI will be notified.


4. The Single UI will then close the WebSocket connection upon successful confirmation.



Acceptance Criteria:
✅ The Disconnect API should be called when a conversation chat is closed.
✅ A "closed session" event should be sent via WebSocket to trigger the API call.
✅ The bridge should handle the API request and response properly.
✅ The Single UI should close the WebSocket connection after receiving a successful response.
✅ The solution should be tested to ensure smooth session closure.

Let me know if you need any refinements! 🚀
