I have completed the following implementations for the file upload functionality in the bridge:

Added a check to determine if image upload is required, using data from the Secret Manager based on the provided appid.
Added the apiKey for the specified appid in the Secret Manager.
If the provided URL does not contain a file name, a file name is generated dynamically based on the contentType.
Successfully implemented file upload functionality to AWS S3.

Title: Generate and Display One-Time Password on Successful User Creation

Description:

When a user is created, a password should be automatically generated and displayed only once after successful user creation. The password will not be shown again, so users or admins need to ensure they save the credentials immediately.

Requirements:

Password Generation:
Automatically generate a strong password during the user creation process.
One-Time Display:
After successful user creation, display the generated password on the screen, informing the user/admin that this is the only time it will be shown.
Add a message to the UI prompting the user to save the password securely, as it will not be retrievable later.
UI Changes:
Modify the user creation success message to include the generated password.
Add a clear instruction in the UI to ensure the password is saved immediately.
No Password Storage for Viewing:
Ensure that after the initial display, the password is not retrievable from the UI or API.
The system should not provide any way to view the password again after the initial creation display.
Acceptance Criteria:

A strong password is generated automatically at the time of user creation.
The generated password is displayed only once after successful creation and is not viewable again.
A clear prompt is shown to save the password immediately.
Ensure that if the password is not saved, the only way to access the account is through a password reset process.
Testing:

Verify that a strong password is generated during user creation.
Validate that the password is displayed only once after successful user creation.
Ensure that the password is not accessible after the initial display.
Test scenarios where users forget to save the password and ensure they can reset it through the usual password recovery process.


Description:

The User entity already contains a teams field (array of Team IDs), but this field is not available for user creation through the UI or API. We need to expose the teams field in the UserDto and ensure it is available for user creation.

Current Fields in User Creation:

name: User's full name
organizationId: ID of the organization the user belongs to
roleId: ID representing the role assigned to the user
teams: Already present in the entity but not available in UserDto for creation
Changes Required:

UserDto (Creation):
Add the teams field (array of Team IDs) to UserDto so it can be used during the user creation process in the API.
UI Changes:
Modify the user creation UI to include a field for selecting one or more teams (an array of team IDs).
Ensure users can select from a list of available teams during the creation process.
Acceptance Criteria:

The teams field is added to UserDto and is available for user creation via the API.
The teams field is displayed in the user creation form in the UI, allowing users to select teams.
Validate that the user creation process successfully associates the user with the selected teams.
Ensure backward compatibility so that users can still be created without selecting teams (optional field).
Testing:

Verify that the teams field is correctly processed when a user is created via the API.
Validate that the UI allows selecting teams and that the selected teams are correctly saved for the new user.
Ensure users without any selected teams can still be created successfully.


Title: Add "Teams" field to User entity with an array of Team IDs

Description:

We need to update the existing User entity by adding a new field to store the association with teams. The new field will hold an array of Team IDs.

Current Fields:

name: User's full name
organizationId: ID of the organization the user belongs to
roleId: ID representing the role assigned to the user
New Field to Add:

teams: An array of Team IDs (e.g., teams: [teamId1, teamId2, teamId3])
Acceptance Criteria:

The teams field should be an array of integers or UUIDs, representing the Team IDs the user is part of.
Ensure backward compatibility with existing users who do not yet have any teams.
Update any relevant services, models, and database schemas to include this new field.
Modify API endpoints where necessary to handle this new field for create, update, and fetch operations.
Testing:

Ensure that the teams field can be properly populated and retrieved via API.
Validate that users without teams do not break any existing functionality.

Title: Proxy Error Causing Intermittent Failures in Auth and Message APIs

Description:

We have observed a Proxy Error impacting both the auth API and the message API. The issue is not isolated to the auth API; it affects both APIs due to network disturbances.

Detailed Analysis:
Auth API:
The auth API is failing on the first hit due to the absence of a configured retry count. Since no retry mechanism is in place, the authentication process stops immediately upon encountering the error.
Message API:
The message API also experiences the same proxy-related error. However, it has a retry count configured. The retry mechanism triggers upon failure, leading to a successful response on subsequent attempts.
Root Cause:
The underlying cause appears to be related to network or proxy issues. The proxy error is affecting multiple APIs, not just the auth API. Other APIs are also experiencing impacts due to network disruptions at the same time.
Recommendations:
Configure Retry Mechanism:
Implement a retry mechanism for the auth API, similar to the one used for the message API. This will ensure that the auth API can connect successfully on subsequent attempts if the initial request fails due to a proxy error.
Investigate Network Stability:
Conduct a thorough investigation to identify the root cause of the network disturbances. Understanding and resolving these network issues will be crucial in preventing similar proxy errors across all APIs.



Hi,

Could we schedule a call to discuss an issue I’m facing with entity mapping, specifically with or without using @DBRef?

When I update a child entity individually, the changes are not reflected everywhere, and the system is still returning the old value. I believe it would be helpful to review this together.

Please let me know a convenient time for you.

Thank you!

Hi,

Could we schedule a call to discuss an issue I’m facing with entity mapping, particularly with or without using @DBRef?

The problem occurs when we update an entity individually. If that entity is also part of another entity, the updated details do not reflect when we fetch the other entity. Instead, we still see the old details of the updated entity. I think it would be useful to review this together.

Please let me know a convenient time for you.

Thank you!
