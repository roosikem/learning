Added the apiKey for the specified appid in the Secret Manager.
If the provided URL does not contain a file name, a file name is generated dynamically based on the contentType.
Successfully implemented file upload functionality to AWS S3.

Title: Generate and Display One-Time Password on Successful User Creation

Description:

When a user is created, a password should be automatically generated and displayed only once after successful user creation. The password will not be shown again, so users or admins need to ensure they save the credentials immediately.

Requirements:

Password Generation:
Automatically generate a strong password during the user creation process.
One-Time Display:
After successful user creation, display the generated password on the screen, informing the user/admin that this is the only time it will be shown.
Add a message to the UI prompting the user to save the password securely, as it will not be retrievable later.
UI Changes:
Modify the user creation success message to include the generated password.
Add a clear instruction in the UI to ensure the password is saved immediately.
No Password Storage for Viewing:
Ensure that after the initial display, the password is not retrievable from the UI or API.
The system should not provide any way to view the password again after the initial creation display.
Acceptance Criteria:

A strong password is generated automatically at the time of user creation.
The generated password is displayed only once after successful creation and is not viewable again.
A clear prompt is shown to save the password immediately.
Ensure that if the password is not saved, the only way to access the account is through a password reset process.
Testing:

Verify that a strong password is generated during user creation.
Validate that the password is displayed only once after successful user creation.
Ensure that the password is not accessible after the initial display.
Test scenarios where users forget to save the password and ensure they can reset it through the usual password recovery process.


Description:

The User entity already contains a teams field (array of Team IDs), but this field is not available for user creation through the UI or API. We need to expose the teams field in the UserDto and ensure it is available for user creation.

Current Fields in User Creation:

name: User's full name
organizationId: ID of the organization the user belongs to
roleId: ID representing the role assigned to the user
teams: Already present in the entity but not available in UserDto for creation
Changes Required:

UserDto (Creation):
Add the teams field (array of Team IDs) to UserDto so it can be used during the user creation process in the API.
UI Changes:
Modify the user creation UI to include a field for selecting one or more teams (an array of team IDs).
Ensure users can select from a list of available teams during the creation process.
Acceptance Criteria:

The teams field is added to UserDto and is available for user creation via the API.
The teams field is displayed in the user creation form in the UI, allowing users to select teams.
Validate that the user creation process successfully associates the user with the selected teams.
Ensure backward compatibility so that users can still be created without selecting teams (optional field).
Testing:

Verify that the teams field is correctly processed when a user is created via the API.
Validate that the UI allows selecting teams and that the selected teams are correctly saved for the new user.
Ensure users without any selected teams can still be created successfully.


Title: Add "Teams" field to User entity with an array of Team IDs

Description:

We need to update the existing User entity by adding a new field to store the association with teams. The new field will hold an array of Team IDs.

Current Fields:

name: User's full name
organizationId: ID of the organization the user belongs to
roleId: ID representing the role assigned to the user
New Field to Add:

teams: An array of Team IDs (e.g., teams: [teamId1, teamId2, teamId3])
Acceptance Criteria:

The teams field should be an array of integers or UUIDs, representing the Team IDs the user is part of.
Ensure backward compatibility with existing users who do not yet have any teams.
Update any relevant services, models, and database schemas to include this new field.
Modify API endpoints where necessary to handle this new field for create, update, and fetch operations.
Testing:

Ensure that the teams field can be properly populated and retrieved via API.
Validate that users without teams do not break any existing functionality.

Title: Proxy Error Causing Intermittent Failures in Auth and Message APIs

Description:

We have observed a Proxy Error impacting both the auth API and the message API. The issue is not isolated to the auth API; it affects both APIs due to network disturbances.

Detailed Analysis:
Auth API:
The auth API is failing on the first hit due to the absence of a configured retry count. Since no retry mechanism is in place, the authentication process stops immediately upon encountering the error.
Message API:
The message API also experiences the same proxy-related error. However, it has a retry count configured. The retry mechanism triggers upon failure, leading to a successful response on subsequent attempts.
Root Cause:
The underlying cause appears to be related to network or proxy issues. The proxy error is affecting multiple APIs, not just the auth API. Other APIs are also experiencing impacts due to network disruptions at the same time.
Recommendations:
Configure Retry Mechanism:
Implement a retry mechanism for the auth API, similar to the one used for the message API. This will ensure that the auth API can connect successfully on subsequent attempts if the initial request fails due to a proxy error.
Investigate Network Stability:
Conduct a thorough investigation to identify the root cause of the network disturbances. Understanding and resolving these network issues will be crucial in preventing similar proxy errors across all APIs.



Hi,

Could we schedule a call to discuss an issue I’m facing with entity mapping, specifically with or without using @DBRef?

When I update a child entity individually, the changes are not reflected everywhere, and the system is still returning the old value. I believe it would be helpful to review this together.

Please let me know a convenient time for you.

Thank you!

Hi,

Could we schedule a call to discuss an issue I’m facing with entity mapping, particularly with or without using @DBRef?

The problem occurs when we update an entity individually. If that entity is also part of another entity, the updated details do not reflect when we fetch the other entity. Instead, we still see the old details of the updated entity. I think it would be useful to review this together.

Please let me know a convenient time for you.

Thank you!

Hi,

function hasImageExtension(fileName) {
    const imageExtensions = ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.gif', '.bmp', '.webp'];
    const lowerCaseFileName = fileName.toLowerCase();
    return imageExtensions.some(extension => lowerCaseFileName.endsWith(extension));
}

"When we use DBRef in a MongoDB entity, there is a problem with entity mapping when there are two separate databases:

Organization - is in database1
Configuration Entity - is in database2
When we try to map the Organization entity inside the Configuration Entity and then retrieve the Configuration from database1, the Organization entity returns as null.

To resolve this problem, we can use:

java
Copy code
@DBRef(db = "databaseName")
This can be used during entity mapping."

Title: Sending File Attachment Object to Chatbot and Updating Existing Request Format

Description:
The current chatbot messaging system does not support sending file attachments alongside text messages. We need to extend the functionality of the formatedMessage method to include file attachment objects and modify the existing request format to handle attachments properly. This task involves adapting the method to ensure that attachments are sent along with the request when present, while maintaining backward compatibility with existing text message functionality.

Acceptance Criteria:

The formatedMessage method should be updated to handle both text and file attachments.
The message payload sent to the chatbot should include:
messageId: Identifier for the message.
content: The text message in textPlain.
attachments: The file attachment(s) if present.
The request format should dynamically adapt based on the presence of attachments, ensuring the attachment object is correctly added to the request when provided.
If neither text nor attachments are present, the method should return an empty object.
Maintain backward compatibility with requests containing only text.
Ensure correct attachment handling in the chatbot for different file types (e.g., PDFs, images).
Technical Details:

Modify the formatedMessage method to check for both text (txt) and attachments (attachments).
Update the request structure to include the attachment object in the message payload if attachments exist.
Ensure the chatbot processes file attachments correctly, alongside or independent of text messages.
Handle cases where only one of the fields (text or attachments) is present, and adjust the request accordingly.
Return an empty object when neither text nor attachments are available.

Subject: Request for Approval to Use Insomnia API Testing Tool
Dear [Recipient's Name],
I hope this email finds you well. After evaluating various API testing tools, we have identified Insomnia as a suitable option that aligns with our security requirements. One of the key features of Insomnia is that it allows us to use the tool without the need for logging in, ensuring that no data is stored in the cloud. This addresses our primary security concern of maintaining full control over sensitive data.
Before proceeding, I would like to kindly request your approval to use Insomnia for our API testing. Please review and confirm that it adheres to all our security norms.
Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your feedback.
Best regards,
